    subtitle: Federal-focused engagements and compliance deliverables
    text: >-
      We deliver scoped security projects from start to finish, with clear milestones, timelines, and outcomes. Our team specializes in federal and enterprise environments where precision and compliance matter.


      **Compliance & Authorization**

      RMF package development including SSP, SAR, POA&M, and architecture/boundary diagrams. We support the full ATO lifecycle from initial documentation through continuous monitoring.


      **Framework Alignment**

      NIST 800-53, FedRAMP, and Zero Trust policy alignment and controls mapping. We map your existing controls to required frameworks and identify gaps.


      **Cloud Security**

      Security reviews and evidence collection for AWS GovCloud and Azure Government workloads. We assess configurations, document findings, and build remediation roadmaps.


      **Detection Engineering**

      Custom detection content for cloud, identity, and endpoint telemetry aligned to federal use cases. We build, test, and tune detections that reduce noise and surface real threats.
