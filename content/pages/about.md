      Founded under Elysium Ventures LLC, Elysium Cyber was built to address a persistent gap in the cybersecurity market: the need for high-quality, specialized security engineering that integrates directly with existing teams.


      Too many organizations struggle with understaffed security teams, mounting compliance requirements, and alert fatigue. Traditional consulting firms deliver reports — we deliver working solutions. Our engineers embed with your team, build the tooling, write the detections, and document the processes so your organization is stronger after we leave.


      We focus on the areas where technical depth matters most: detection engineering, SOAR automation, cloud security for government workloads, and compliance documentation that actually reflects your environment.

      Elysium Cyber was founded by **Aatir Siddiqui**, a cybersecurity engineer with experience across federal programs, enterprise security operations, and cloud infrastructure. Aatir started the firm to bridge the gap between what security teams need and what they can realistically staff — providing expert engineering capacity on demand, without the overhead of traditional consulting.
